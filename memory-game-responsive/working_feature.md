I removed the width and height from .game-container to make responsive sizing easier across different screen sizes using media queries. Since .game-container is now a flex column, I encountered an issue with button placement, which I resolved by creating a separate button container. I also removed the aspect ratio for the cards, ensuring they fit within the fruit border without causing vertical scrolling. In the JS code, I removed the gameContainer width style, which eliminated vertical scrolling, and the gameContainer top style no longer shifts the game downward, keeping it properly contained within the fruit border.
