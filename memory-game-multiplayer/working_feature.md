The first change I made was to remove the moves counter and the timer, as I believed it didn't make sense for a multiplayer game to have these features. I then updated the game-info div to hold a counter for each player, as well as an indicator for whose turn it was in the HTML code. I also made sure to create two different styles for matched cards to clearly show which player matched which cards. A style was created for the player's turn indicator, and a feature was added in the JS file to properly switch the indicator between players when it was their turn. I adjusted the checkForMatch function so that once a player made a match, their score was incremented and the card's border matched their color. Once that was working, I continued to edit the code so that the player's turn switched only if the cards didnâ€™t match, and if they did match, their turn would continue.
